CobaltDB can now auto-detect errors and will repair itself accordingly.
Fixed CobaltDB "disconnect" that many server/network owners were reporting.
Changed out the Lua DLLs to support the new server version.
Added psudeo random number generator, it currently operates off a linear congruential generator, though in the future i want to add some entropy by stacking multiple generators under one master generator.
Fixed BeamMPconfig bug that may or may not be fixed and may or may not have existed on the live build
Added the ability to set new log types to be used with CElog(output,heading) with setLogType(heading,headingColor,conditionFunc,stringColor) the colors use 3 and 4 bit ANSI color codes, the conditionFunc is ran when the log type is executed, if it returns false, the message will not be displayed.
You may also get the aforementioned log types with getLogTypes()
Implemented on vehicle reset event support.
Temporarily removed date and time from CElog() since the new server version has it, negotiating a rawPrint() function as we speak.

Fix for a dumb bug with beamMPconfig metatable/object in lua which was causing problems with certain extensions and the setcfg command.
