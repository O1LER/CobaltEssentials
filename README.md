# CobaltEssentials
CobaltEssentials for BeamMP Servers

## Basic Owner Setup of CobaltEssentials

This guide will walk through the most basic process of installing **CobaltEssentials** onto a **BeamMP Server** and setting yourself as the **owner**.

This assumes you have successfully set up your own **BeamMP Server**, there is a guide **[here](https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/server-installation)**.

### Installation and setting yourself as owner:
1. Get the latest **CobaltEssentials** from the **[CobaltEssentials GitHub](https://github.com/prestonelam2003/CobaltEssentials)**

2. With the **BeamMP Server** ***NOT*** running:
    * Make sure **CobaltEssentials** is extracted correctly into the server **Resources** directory as: `â€¦/Resources/Server/CobaltEssentials`

3. **Launch** the server with CobaltEssentials installed.

4. In the server console, run the command `ce setgroup yourName owner`, replacing `yourName` with your BeamMP username.

You are now set with owner permissions.
